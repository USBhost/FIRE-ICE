config FRAME_POINTER
	bool
	default y

config ARM_PTDUMP
	bool "Export kernel pagetable layout to userspace via debugfs"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	select DEBUG_FS
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want to show the kernel pagetable layout in a
	  debugfs file. This information is only useful for kernel developers
	  who are working in architecture specific areas of the kernel.
	  It is probably not a good idea to enable this feature in a production
	  kernel.
	  If in doubt, say "N"

config DEBUG_STACK_USAGE
	bool "Enable stack utilization instrumentation"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Enables the display of the minimum amount of free stack which each
	  task has ever had available in the sysrq-T output.

config EARLY_PRINTK
	bool "Early printk support"
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to have an early console using the
	  earlyprintk=<name>[,<addr>][,<options>] kernel parameter. It
	  is assumed that the early console device has been initialised
	  by the boot loader prior to starting the Linux kernel.

config PID_IN_CONTEXTIDR
	bool "Write the current PID to the CONTEXTIDR register"
	help
	  Enabling this option causes the kernel to write the current PID to
	  the CONTEXTIDR register, at the expense of some additional
	  instructions during context switch. Say Y here only if you are
	  planning to use hardware trace tools with this kernel.

config OPTIMIZE_INLINING
	bool "Allow gcc to uninline functions marked 'inline'"
	---help---
	  This option determines if the kernel forces gcc to inline the functions
	  developers have marked 'inline'. Doing so takes away freedom from gcc to
	  do what it thinks is best, which is desirable for the gcc 3.x series of
	  compilers. The gcc 4.x series have a rewritten inlining algorithm and
	  enabling this option will generate a smaller kernel there. Hopefully
	  this algorithm is so good that allowing gcc 4.x and above to make the
	  decision will become the default in the future. Until then this option
	  is there to test gcc for this.

	  If unsure, say N.
